import socket

# replace the file path with your desired file path for storing the computer name
LOG_FILE_PATH = "computer_name_log.txt"

# get the computer name using the socket library
computer_name = socket.gethostname()

# write the computer name to the log file
with open(LOG_FILE_PATH, "a") as log_file:
    log_file.write(f"{computer_name}\n")



#This code uses the socket library to get the computer name using the gethostname function. It then writes the computer name to a log file (in this case, computer_name_log.txt) using Python's built-in open function. The a mode is used to open the file in append mode so that new computer names are added to the end of the file rather than overwriting the existing contents.
