#This script defines regular expressions for Ethereum and Bitcoin wallet addresses, and uses the re and os modules to search for wallet addresses in files in a given directory. The search_wallets function searches for wallet addresses in a single file, while the scan_directory function searches for wallet addresses in all files in a given directory and its subdirectories.
