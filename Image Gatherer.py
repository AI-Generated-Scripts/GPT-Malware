for root, dirs, files in os.walk(PICTURE_DIRECTORY):

#This code uses the os library to loop through all the files in a directory (in this case, the directory containing your pictures) and the zipfile library to create a ZIP file containing any JPG or PNG files found in the directory. You'll need to replace the PICTURE_DIRECTORY variable with the path to the directory containing your pictures and the ZIP_FILE_PATH variable with the desired file path for the ZIP file.
