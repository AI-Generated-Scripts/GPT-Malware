#This code uses the requests library to send a GET request to an API that returns your public IP address (in this case, https://api.ipify.org). It then writes the IP address to a log file (in this case, ip_log.txt) using Python's built-in open function. The a mode is used to open the file in append mode so that new IP addresses are added to the end of the file rather than overwriting the existing contents.
