    #This script continuously monitors the clipboard and logs any data that is copied into a text file named "clipboard_log.txt". The script uses the win32clipboard module to access the clipboard contents on a Windows machine. The script uses a while loop to continuously monitor the clipboard and a time.sleep() call to pause the loop for 5 seconds between checks. The clipboard data is logged into the text file along with the current date and time using the time.strftime() function.
