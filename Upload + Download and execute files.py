        #This script defines three functions: upload_file(), download_file(), and execute_command().

#upload_file() takes a local file path as input and sends a POST request to the remote server to upload the file.

#download_file() takes a remote file name as input and sends a GET request to the remote server to download the file.

#execute_command() takes a command as input and executes it on the local machine using the subprocess module.

#The script then enters a loop that reads commands from the user and performs the appropriate action based on the command. If the command contains the word "upload", it calls upload_file(). If the command contains the word "download", it calls download_file(). Otherwise, it calls execute_command() to execute the command on the local machine.
