import pyautogui

# Disable right click
pyautogui.FAILSAFE = False
pyautogui.PAUSE = 0
pyautogui.mouseDown(button='right')
pyautogui.mouseUp(button='right')


#The script disables the failsafe feature of pyautogui so that the script can run without any interruption. It then sets the pause between the mouse down and mouse up events to 0 to make the action as quick as possible. Finally, it simulates a right click by calling pyautogui.mouseDown() with the button parameter set to 'right', and then pyautogui.mouseUp() with the same button parameter.
